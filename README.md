# Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis-With-a-twist-of-contextual-Augmentation-with-Google-BERT-and-RTT
Machine Learning case study 2

Overview :

Aspect-based sentiment analysis is fine-grained sentiment analysis, which aims to spot a transparent level of sentiment polarity in relevance a specific aspect to raised granular understanding of the merchandise. This work is concentrated on Aspect based sentiment analysis with contextual augmentation with Google Bert and Round-trip translation (RTT) and the model accuracies comparison between XgBoost Model and Neural Network Sequential Model. Here, first we are going use Google BERT as novel data augmentation for labelled sentences called contextual augmentation.  We assumed invariance that sentences are natural whether or not the words within the sentences are replaced with other words with paradigmatic relations. Second is Round-trip translation (RTT),  is additionally referred to as re-cursive, back-and-forth, and bi-directional translation.  The most assumption of ABSA is that the complete text has all-inclusive polarity. The dataset we are going use is restaurant review datasets from SemEval 2014. The output we are going to get is that the Ranking of Aspect Categories in range of 1 to 5 and how much percentage the polarity contains by every ranking . Also comparison of the detailed sentiment analysis of the input review on the premise of aspects and polarity mentioned. This is the most efficient way from a business point of view.
